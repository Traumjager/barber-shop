## Team members:

1. Hatem Husnieh
2. Ahmad Ammoura
3. Mohammed Al-Ramahi
4. Ahmad Abu Osbeh


## Cooperation Plan

**Our team is full with ambition and energy, Our main goal is to deliver the best possible result in our project and I'm sure that we can make everything happen because this is how it works! and the best way to do it by utilizing our skills individually and as a team and as a team  leader of this team I'll get the best of myself because leadership is something sort of missing in my personality as a professional competency and each member of the team will get the better of themselves too!**

## Conflict Plan

**We all agreed to be cooperative and productive workers and when any issues or conflicts or any kind of disagreement arises we will vote for any suggestions and the highest
votes solution would be applied and all of us will be happy about it and no further issues will happen in that specific thing.**
 
**The main goal of this course was to make us better with all aspects including our technical aspect and by any chance, if I felt that one of the team members is trying to take over the others work I'll try to talk to him and convince him to take a step back and give the others the opportunity and by any chance and I'm sure that will not happen I'll
be reporting him for our lovely instructor and I know that all of us may differ in our skills base but that doesn't mean one person should contribute more than the others instead we can all make benefits of it and learn some new stuff and as I said if any individual doesn't comply after several tries to the resolution will be reported to the instructor.**

## Communication Plan

**Most of the time all of the team members should be comfortable communicating at day and maybe sometimes at night and we'll be using several tools to communicate:**

 - Slack
 - Phone
 - Zoom
 - Discord

**We will take breaks regularly based on the efforts made and work done by that time and by any chance I felt that we started to fall behind I think that we work harder and take fewer breaks and be more active even at late night.**

**Everyone should give his opinion and I'll make sure that is everyone is contributing by asking them regularly about their opinions.**

## Work Plan

**I'll be giving tasks in a way that everyone has a chance to work on each side (The frontend and the backend) and it will be pretty balanced to allow each team member to contribute and I will be using Trello to help us achieve this.**

## Git Process


**each one of us will have the chance to access the repositories from the organization that we made and for the workflow, it will be like this:**

1. Start a new feature.
2. Finish up a feature.
3. Review a feature for any possible issues or conflicts.
4. Publish a feature.
5. Getting a published feature.
6. Release at the end.

**Two Individuals at least will review the PR and the leader will merge to main and by each finished feature I'll merge that work and I'll report other team members and meet if possible to commit the merge**
